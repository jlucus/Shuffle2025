# üß† Crypto Hack Network Analysis

[Breadcrumbs Report Exports](https://www.breadcrumbs.app/reports/20604)

This repository contains a **Python-based forensic analysis** of blockchain wallet activity related to a cryptocurrency exploit.  
It uses **Pandas** for data cleaning and **Plotly** for interactive visualization of transactional behaviors, wallet categories, and relationships between entities (EOAs, smart contracts, and exploit-related addresses).

![Total Transaction Volume by Address Category](plots/newplot.png)

Shows overall transaction flow segmented by entity type, highlighting disproportionate activity in exploit-associated wallets.

## üßÆ 2. Smart Contract vs EOA Distribution by Category

![Smart Contract vs EOA Distribution](plots/newplot1.png)

Demonstrates which address categories rely more heavily on smart contracts versus EOAs (Externally Owned Accounts).

## üîç 3. Transaction Behavior ‚Äî Received vs Sent

![Transaction Behavior ‚Äî Received vs Sent](plots/newplot2.png)

Scatter plot visualizing incoming vs outgoing transaction counts.  
Exploit-related addresses appear as outliers, with asymmetric send/receive ratios.

Highlights the most active participants in the exploit network, revealing high-frequency wallets linked to MEV bots and laundering nodes.

### üß† Research Context

This repository supports blockchain forensic efforts aimed at mapping out post-exploit fund movements.  
By categorizing and visualizing transactional behaviors, this analysis helps identify laundering strategies and CEX/DeFi bridge points used to obfuscate stolen funds.

## üìä Overview

This analysis investigates transaction data extracted from two CSV datasets:

- `Address.csv` ‚Äî metadata about wallet addresses (names, contract flags, etc.)
- `Transactions.csv` ‚Äî raw transaction-level data between addresses

The goal is to classify and visualize address behaviors to reveal:
- Patterns of exploit activity  
- Flow between exploiters, exchanges (CEX), and DeFi protocols  
- Links between individual and contract-level wallets  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

The script performs the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**
   - Reads address and transaction data
   - Normalizes ‚ÄúIs Smart Contract‚Äù fields
   - Computes total transaction counts per address

2. **Categorization of Entities**
   - Classifies each address into categories such as:
     - `ftx_mev_bot`
     - `ftx_hack_token`
     - `ftx_associated`
     - `cex` (Centralized Exchanges)
     - `defi` (DeFi protocols)
     - `individual` (personal wallets)
     - `exploiter`
     - `unlabeled`
   - Categorization is rule-based using address names and flags

3. **Visual Analytics**
   - Generates four key visualizations:
     1. **Transaction Volume by Category (Bar Chart)**  
        Compares total transaction activity across wallet types.

     2. **Smart Contract vs EOA Distribution (Stacked Bar Chart)**  
        Highlights contract-heavy versus externally owned address groups.

     3. **Transaction Behavior Scatter Plot**  
        Plots `TX Received` vs `TX Sent` to reveal outliers and exploit movement.

     4. **Top 10 Addresses by Total TX Volume (Horizontal Bar Chart)**  
        Displays the most active wallets with category context.

## üß† Research Context

This repository is part of a broader blockchain forensics effort to trace exploit-related funds through decentralized and centralized systems.

By combining data-driven labeling with visual analytics, the analysis reveals behavioral signatures of wallets involved in complex laundering and arbitrage chains.
